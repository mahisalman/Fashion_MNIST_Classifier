# 🧥 Fashion MNIST Image Classifier – CNN + Flask Web App

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload an image of a fashion item (e.g., shirt, sneaker, bag) and classifies it using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.

The app features:
- 🔍 Real-time image classification
- 🧠 Robust preprocessing (resize, normalize, center the object)
- 📸 Live preview of uploaded image
- 💡 Displays top 3 predictions with confidence scores
- 🎨 Beautiful and responsive HTML/CSS interface
